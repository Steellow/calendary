Rebuild form... css seems to be fucked up
Try different html2canvas options
	Using original div, with scale 7 results in best quality but big filesize (over 1mb)
	Using copy div with no transform results almos as good quality and smaller filesize (0.5mb)
	Maybe do copy div but change the size to super big, and use no scale?
