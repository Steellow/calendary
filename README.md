# Calendary

_Calendary_ as in _calendar_ and _legendary_. A web app for generating printable wall calendars.

Super work-in-progress, no ETA for release :D

## Inspo

I want to create something as smooth and customizable as [flowcv.io](https://flowcv.com/), but for calendars!

## Coventions

- In the code date related numbers start from 1, not 0
  - When using 0-based parameter it's always with `index`
  - For example, `month = 9` and `monthIndex = 8` would both be September
  - It's easier for me to wrap my head around in date loops when counting starts from 1
